# PRODIGY_DS_02

This project was completed as part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The objective of Task 01 is to create a visualization (bar chart or histogram) to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

For this task, I analyzed the World Population Dataset, focusing on visualizing the distribution of populations across different countries or age groups.

📊 Objective Create a Bar Chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical variable (e.g., Countries/Regions).

Create a Histogram to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable (e.g., Age distribution).
